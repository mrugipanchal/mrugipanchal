		        <p>MakerYatra was an enlightening journey to explore, connect and learn from
the rural India.The first MakerYatra, one of its kind, happened in Idar, a
town surrounded by rocky mountains of Aravali range in North Gujarat. In 5
days, we visited more than 15 villages. We explored amazing talents in
agriculture, robotics, aviation, engineering and education which will be a
life-changing experience. From going to an organic farm to visiting a man
who created his own parahelicopter, from visiting an ayurvedic medicine
production facility to taking a walk in the first village of that area to bring on
the drip irrigation system, we had a huge spectrum of experiences. It was a
journey to get together to feel what talent is lying unidentified by the world
by being a connecting link to take them for scaling up their insight for a
larger good by making a connection with the right people at the right
time. Participants were from a very diverse background from all walks of life
to get insights into the growing rural community thinking for the betterment
of rural India. Ranging from a Grade 6 student to a scientist from
IPR(Institute of Plasma Research), the participants brought with them their
diverse perspectives. We were received warmly everywhere we went. The
things we experienced, the people we met, the sights we beholded, would
stay with us a very very long time ahead.

Day 1
We started our journey on 19 th of December, 2018 from UniqYOU
International School, Idar in a tractor. Yes, all the Yatris (the participants),</p>

		        <p>Swagat Organic Farm, headed by a farmer named Mr. Vinod Patel, was one
of the first places in Gujarat where organic farming was started. We were
graciously welcomed by him. Organic farming is Organic farming is an
alternative agricultural system which originated early in the 20th century in
reaction to rapidly changing farming practices. It relies on fertilizers of
organic origin and places emphasis on environment friendly techniques. In
general, organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally
occurring substances while prohibiting or strictly limiting synthetic
substances. This visit made me aware of what type of food I should be
eating. As it turned out, organic farming required lots of paperwork and the
certification period is of almost 3 years. The ground has to be detoxified was
a period of 3 years, in which you cannot grow anything useful on it. It is a big
gamble for a farmer, because even after detoxifying his field, there is no
surety of certification from the government. It also requires skilled labour,
which is costly as compared to normal, unskilled labour. Therefore, many
farmers are vary of organic farming today. But Vinodbhai braved all these
odds and started his dream project. He knew that adapting new technology
always brings its challenges. Vinodbhai says that the wait for 3 years taught
him something we all have forgotten in our busy day to day lives - patience.
Bill Gates once famously said that “Great thing take time“. Today,
Vinodbhai’s fields yield much more than they earlier used to, plus now they are making more than double per quintal as compared to what they were
earning before, and the crops are medically superior in quality.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Oveshbhai Dodiya</h3>
		     <p> 
A resident of the village Mangarh in Gujarat, this 9th class failed man made
his own paramotor (a helicopter of sorts). This man had a simple dream: “I
want to fly”. But a scarcely very few of us do follow our dreams, often mixed
in the hustle bustle of our private and professional life. Through his strong
grit and determination and years of persistence, he has achieved this dream.
After attending his shop every day from 9 to 5, he took time everyday for his
passion. He took apart his bike’s engine system and further redeveloped it.
Oveshbahi possesses an understanding for machines comparable to the best
automobile engineering professors. It is said that the first time he flew,
almost all the villagers were on their roof to witness this. We were invited to
his house, were he had displayed all his previous attempts. Oveshbhai
proudly states that he has crash landed 7 times, sometimes even in lush
green crop fields, but even the farmer, whose field was partially destroyed,
said that he was more concerned about Oveshbhai’s safety than his own
field. Learning, not hiding, from failures is something we all should learn
from him. A very humble man, he answered all our fanboy questions with
particular delight. We were lucky, as it was one of his “fly days”. The sight of
him taking off, with those thundering roar of motors, amidst a huge
appaulding assemble, was a sight to behold. Though we didn’t actually fly
with him, nobody can say we didn’t feel it. It seemed that Oveshbhai wasn’t
flying alone, we too were there. Seeing him fly instilled, or rather reinstilled
a sense of purpose in ourselves  </p>
